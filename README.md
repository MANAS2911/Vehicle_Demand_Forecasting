This project focuses on predicting vehicle demand using historical data. It involves data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and training a machine learning model. A linear regression model is implemented and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure performance. Key Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn are used for data manipulation, visualization, and model development. The notebook provides insights into user behavior patterns, helping optimize bike-sharing services. To use the project, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the Jupyter Notebook. Future enhancements include integrating advanced models and adding features like traffic data for improvedÂ accuracy.
